# Infection

This is a python program that simulates a bunch of bouncing circles that "infect" each other. One ball starts green and spreads the color through collision 

## How It Works

- Uses the Pygame library for graphics visualization
- Uses elastic collision math for simulaitng collision

## What I Learned
This project was a crucial starting point for learning how 2d physics and how to implement them
